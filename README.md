# Car-Price-Prediction

The rapid evolution of the automotive industry, coupled with the growing demand for efficient and accurate pricing mechanisms, has prompted the exploration of advanced data-driven approaches for car price prediction. This project delves into the realm of regression analysis to develop a predictive model for estimating car prices based on a set of relevant features. Leveraging a carefully curated dataset sourced from Kaggle.com, the study employs a comprehensive regression analysis technique to discern the intricate relationships between various attributes and the final market value of automobiles.

The project encompasses a thorough exploration of related literature, shedding light on prior methodologies and findings in the domain of car price prediction. The dataset undergoes meticulous preprocessing, including feature selection and engineering, to ensure the model's robustness and relevance. The regression model is then trained and evaluated using standard metrics, providing a quantitative measure of its predictive performance. Results indicate an 86% Accuracy, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in capturing the nuanced factors influencing car prices.
